# Python Scripts for REST and NETCONF API

## REST API

This is a sample python script that can be used for REST API automation.
Tested for Python 2.7 and Python 3.
This example uses [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) . 

Another alternative would be using  [urlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html)



### Usage

1. Set environment variables

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    python rest-python.py
    ```

## NETCONF API

There are several netconf libraries for python.
The one I found pretty straight forward and effective is **[ncclient](https://ncclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)**.

There are several examples of usage documented in [their documentation](https://ncclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html)




### Pip Install [ncclient](https://pypi.org/project/ncclient/)

1. Set environment variables

    ```bash
    pip install ncclient
    ```
