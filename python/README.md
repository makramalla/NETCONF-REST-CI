# Python Scripts for REST and NETCONF API

## REST API

This is a sample python script that can be used for REST API automation.
Tested for Python 2.7 and Python 3.
This example uses [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) . 

Another alternative would be using  [urlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html)



### Usage

1. Set environment variables

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    python rest-python.py
    ```
